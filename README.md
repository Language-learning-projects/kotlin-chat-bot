# Kotlin chat bot

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Kotlin chat bot".

It's purpose is to build a chat bot using Kotlin and it's concepts/libraries.

## Idea

A possible project idea for Kotlin is to build a chatbot that can interact with users using natural language and provide them with useful information or entertainment. The chatbot will use Kotlinâ€™s coroutines for concurrency and asynchronous programming, Ktor for building web applications and APIs, Kotlinx.serialization for working with JSON data, Kotlin DSL for writing expressive and concise code, Koin for dependency injection, and Dialogflow for natural language processing and intent recognition. The chatbot will be able to answer questions and have conversations with users on various topics, such as weather, sports, news, trivia, jokes, etc. The chatbot will also be able to handle different user intents, such as greeting, thanking, requesting, complaining, etc. The chatbot will be a fun and engaging way to learn the concepts of Kotlin and its features.
